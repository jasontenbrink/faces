//store all active user info here.  Will need a link to data factory.  Directory controller
//Will have to inject this as a dependancy as well.  Api calls will be familyData - get's the first names
// of each family member and picture of family.  call to get family member data - returns array
//with each family member in it.  Will include first and last name, email, some phone numbers,
//and some addresses. Family position?  Seems useful.  could just mark child and parent.  Don't worry about that
//for now.
